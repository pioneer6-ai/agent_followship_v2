"""
Decision engines: how the agent chooses what to do about a case.

The agent's decision used to be a hardcoded ``if/elif`` cascade buried inside the
orchestrator. That is a perfectly good *policy* but a poor *decision engine*: it
cannot take context into account beyond the handful of fields it tests, and it
cannot explain itself in the patient's own terms.

This module separates the two concerns:

* :class:`RuleDecisionEngine` keeps the clinic's deterministic policy. It also
  produces the set of actions that are *permissible* for a case, which is what
  makes the rules a **guardrail** rather than a competitor.
* :class:`LlmDecisionEngine` asks Claude to choose among the permissible actions
  using its tool-use API, so the choice is structured and auditable instead of
  free text. It is strictly subordinate to the rules: any answer outside the
  permissible set, any malformed answer, and any API failure all fall back to the
  rule engine, so the agent keeps working with no API key and can never be talked
  into an action the clinic did not sanction.

Selection precedence for :attr:`ActionDecision.source`, which is recorded on every
decision for audit:

``rules``
    The rule engine answered (its own default, or the LLM is disabled/absent).
``llm``
    Claude chose, and the choice was permissible.
``llm-guardrail``
    Claude chose something impermissible or unparseable; rules overrode it.
``llm-error``
    The API call failed; rules answered instead.
